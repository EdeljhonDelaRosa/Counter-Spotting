Counter-Spotting
How to use
1. Open the Counter-Spotting popup (click the toolbar icon).
2. The first-time onboarding instructions will appear in the popup; read and click "Enable Extension" to turn it on.
	- Note: Enabling does NOT enable proxy or decoy traffic by default — you must opt into those features.
3. In the popup, enable "Proxy Routing" only if you have a trusted relay endpoint (or want to use a research relay).
4. Enable "Decoy Traffic" if you want background noise, set Decoy Rate (0–1) to control frequency.
Privacy & Safety Notes
- The extension reduces linkable metadata but cannot guarantee full anonymity.
- Use your own proxy/relay if privacy is critical, do not send credentials through unknown relays.
- keep the decoy rate low if bandwidth is a concern.
